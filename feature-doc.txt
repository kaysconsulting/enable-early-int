Early Childhood Intervention 
Supporting Children Early. Empowering Families Always. 
Every child deserves the opportunity to grow, learn, and thrive. At Enable Early Intervention, our Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) services provide tailored support for children aged 0–6 with developmental delays or disabilities—helping them reach key milestones and build strong foundations for life. 
 
We take a holistic, family-centred approach, recognising that no one knows your child better than you. That’s why we work in partnership with families to deliver early, evidence-based support that nurtures every area of development—communication, motor skills, emotional regulation, social interaction, and daily routine. 
 
What We Have Access To 
•	Developmental Assessments: Identify strengths, challenges, and next steps in your child’s growth. 
•	Therapy Services: Access to speech therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, or psychology—based on your child’s needs and goals. 
•	Family Coaching & Support: Practical strategies to support learning and connection at home, in childcare, and in the community. 
•	NDIS-Approved Services: We guide families through eligibility, planning, and goal-setting within the NDIS Early Childhood Approach. 
•	Inclusive Practice: Services can be delivered in your home, in community settings, online, or wherever your child learns best. 
 
Our Educational Plan Includes: 
Child and Adolescents Mental Health Awareness Parent Training Workshops 
•	These workshops aim to equip parents with the knowledge and tools to identify early signs of mental health challenges in their children. By fostering awareness, parents can respond more confidently and seek appropriate support services when needed. 
 
Child Development Parent Education Awareness Training Workshops 
•	These sessions provide parents with a deeper understanding of the key stages of physical, emotional, social, and cognitive development in children. Educated parents are better positioned to nurture growth, manage behavioural concerns, and support their child's overall well-being. 
 
Adolescents Mental Health Awareness Workshops 
•	Designed specifically for parents and guardians of teenagers, these workshops focus on the unique mental health challenges faced during adolescence, such as anxiety, depression, peer pressure, and identity formation. The goal is to strengthen parental support and improve communication between adolescents and their caregivers. 
Why Early Intervention Matters 
The earlier a child receives the right support, the better the outcomes—for learning, behaviour, confidence, and independence. We work alongside you to create an individualised plan that builds on your child’s strengths and adapts as they grow. 
You’re not alone on this journey—our team is here to walk with you.
